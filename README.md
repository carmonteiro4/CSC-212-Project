Book Suggester

Our program is going to ask the user a series of questions about what kind of book they want to read
Fiction or Non-Fiction ranging from 1 to 2. Genre that will have 10 different types ranging the from numbers 0 to 9. The type of book which will have 5 different types ranging from 0 to 4. The length which will be based off page numbers 0 to 100 pages per number ranging from 0 to 9, where 9 repersents 1000 or more pages.
Based on the answer of the user, each answer will give a number for a serial number of a book.
Then, there will be a large database of books with serial numbers, and a function will run to suggest the
user with the most similar 10 books.
Users will also be prompted to input their own book to add to the system.
