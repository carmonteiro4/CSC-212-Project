Book Suggester

Our program is going to ask the user a series of questions about what kind of book they want to read
(genre, difficult of read, length, etc.)
Based on the answer of the user, each answer will give a number for a serial number of a book.
Then, there will be a large database of books with serial numbers, and a function will run to suggest the
user with the most similar 10 books.
